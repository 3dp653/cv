                        I was born in Grand Rapids in 2002. I won't give you my whole life story though,
                        I graduated from Forest Hills Central High School in 2020, officially that is. I went to Kent Innovation
                        High School for most of my schooling. Forest Hills was my sending school,
                        but I never actually attended except for electives. I'm not sure if I will go into to college
                        considering the money sink college is.<br>I am willing to learn, but am not willing to pay
                        thousands of dollars for something I can get certified in myself. I am currently learning Python Programming
                        and I am thinking about going into a career of game development. There is still much I need to learn though.
                        <br>I've liked games and creating things for as long as I can remember and I've always had a passing interest in what
                        `makes computers tick. I am excited to get into the field of programming!
